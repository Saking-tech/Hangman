Welcome to the Hangman for Hollywood Movies GitHub repository! This project hosts a simple yet engaging Python-based Hangman game designed specifically for movie enthusiasts. If you enjoy guessing Hollywood movies, this game provides an entertaining way to test your knowledge.

Game Overview
This Python script powers a classic game of Hangman where the secret words are names of popular Hollywood movies. Players attempt to guess the movie title by suggesting letters within a limited number of guesses. Each incorrect guess brings you closer to losing, represented by the traditional "hangman" drawing that progressively completes with each wrong answer.

Features
Dynamic Movie List: At the core of the game is a customizable list of Hollywood movies. Users can easily add more titles or modify the existing list to refresh the game's challenge or tailor it to a specific audience or theme.
User-Friendly Interface: The game is played entirely through the console, offering a straightforward and accessible user experience. Each step of the game provides clear instructions and feedback, making it easy for players of all ages to engage with.
Flexibility: While the default setup is for Hollywood movies, the script is designed to be versatile. Users can replace the movie list with any other categories such as books, celebrities, or geographical locations, making it a multipurpose Hangman game.
How to Play
To play the game, simply clone this repository and run the Python script. The game will initiate in your command line or terminal. Follow the on-screen prompts to guess letters and try to figure out the movie title before your guesses run out.

Customizing the Movie List
Editing the list of movies is straightforward. Access the movies.txt file in the repository, where each line represents a different movie title. Modify this file as needed to update the game's database.
